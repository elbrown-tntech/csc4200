# PA1 Design — ETP/1 Client and Server

_One to two pages. Short, specific answers beat long general ones. Every section
should be true of the code you submit. Delete these italic prompts when you write._

## 1. Architecture

_Your modules and what calls what. A small diagram (ASCII is fine) or a list:
which file holds the protocol (encode/decode), which holds the transport, which
holds the server's session logic, which holds the client._

## 2. The transport seam

_Which file is your transport? List the six operations as you implemented them.
Confirm that no other file calls the socket API. In two or three sentences: what
would you have to change, and what would stay the same, when you swap TCP for your
PA2 transport in the final project?_

## 3. Framing

_How does your code read one ETP message from a byte stream? Where and how do you
handle a header that arrives in pieces, or two messages that arrive in one read?
Where do you check VERSION and LENGTH, and why before reading the payload?_

## 4. Concurrency

_Threads, processes or an event loop? What happens to everyone else when one
client stalls half-way through a header? Is any state shared between sessions
(for example, two clients PUT and GET the same file at once), and how is it
protected?_

## 5. Errors and disconnects

_How do fatal and non-fatal errors differ in your code? What happens when a client
disconnects in the middle of a GET of a large file? (C: how did you deal with
SIGPIPE?) How does your client choose its exit code?_

## 6. Threat model

_One paragraph. Who could attack an ETP/1 server, and how? Name one attack your
server resists (and how), and one it does not. Chapter 5 §5.9 and the
specification's Security Considerations are good starting points._

## 7. Testing

_What did you test beyond `etp_selfcheck.py`? How? Name one bug your testing
found, how you found it, and the fix._
